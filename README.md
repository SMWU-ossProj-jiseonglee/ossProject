## Introduction
This is **Barrier-Free Map Project** Project conducted as the final project for the Open Source Programming course at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University.   

Using an image classification model built with **EfficientNet**, we classify restaurant entrance photos to determine the presence of stairs.

This project is created to facilitate smoother daily life for wheelchair users. Through this map, wheelchair users can easily fine restaurants that they can access.

## Features
The model was trained through image recognition and allowed the model to distinguish between step images.

Through the image recognition model, the model distinguishes the step image to determine whether the wheelchair is an accessible entrance or not.
